# ORF-finder-using-python

## Description
This repository contains a Python script that identifies Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence. The script analyzes all six reading frames and returns the ORFs along with their corresponding amino acid sequences.

## Features
- **Six Reading Frames Analysis**: The script checks all three forward and three reverse reading frames.
- **Codon Translation**: The script translates DNA codons to their respective amino acids.
- **Stop Codon Detection**: It detects ORFs by finding start (`ATG`) and stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kpmurshid/ORF-finder-using-python.git
   cd ORF-finder-using-python
